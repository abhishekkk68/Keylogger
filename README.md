Keylogger

This project is a simple keylogger application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python. The application can start and stop keylogging with the click of a button, and it logs keystrokes to a file named log.txt.

Features
	Start and stop keylogging with GUI controls.
	Logs all keystrokes to a file.
	Simple and intuitive interface.

Prerequisites
	Python 3.x
	Libraries: pynput, tkinter

Code Explanation

GUI Setup
The GUI is created using the tkinter library. 
It includes:
	A label to display the status of the keylogger.
	"Start Logging" and "Stop Logging" buttons to control the keylogging process.
	Keylogging Functionality

The keylogging is implemented using the pynput library:

	on_press function captures keystrokes and writes them to log.txt.
	A separate thread is used for logging to keep the GUI responsive.

Ethical and Legal Considerations
	Consent: Ensure you have explicit consent from users before logging their keystrokes.
	Legal Compliance: Adhere to local laws and regulations regarding surveillance and data privacy.

Future Enhancements
	Hide the Window: Add functionality to minimize to the system tray.
	Security: Implement password protection for starting/stopping the keylogger.
	Email Logs: Automatically send logs to an email address periodically.
	Format Logs: Improve log formatting with timestamps.
